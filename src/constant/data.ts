      answer:
        "At Exions Tech, we begin by scheduling a meeting to understand your vision and gather all the necessary requirements. Once we have a clear understanding, we create a draft UI design for your review. After receiving your confirmation and approval on the design, we proceed with building the final website, ensuring it aligns perfectly with your expectations. To initiate the project, we require a 30% advance payment.",
